# Notes:
Using the development API the data was based in California so this app defaults the search to California, but is still applicable to filter by state which affects the searches. The map defaultly displays markers in california.

# Summary
This site queries the Bridge API to retrieve and display property information and statistics on the site and displays the properties on a Google Map. Even though this API only has locations based in California this site is applicable to display properties accross the whole United States with the proper data.
